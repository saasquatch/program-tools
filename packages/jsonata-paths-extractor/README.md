# JSONata Paths Extractor

### Installation

Using npm or yarn the package can be installed

`npm i @saasquatch/jsonata-paths-extractor`

## Usage

A single function is exported as the default export. The function accepts a JSONata expression as input and returns the paths found in the expression.

For more detail on behaviour, see `test/paths.feature`

_Example usage:_

```ts
import extractJSONataPaths from "@saasquatch/jsonata-paths-extractor";

const exampleJsonataExpression =
  'example.jsonata.path = "a string" ? example.two : example[two="test"].name^(<three)';

const paths = extractJSONataPaths(exampleJsonataExpression);
// paths: ["/example/jsonata/path","/example/two","/example/name","/example/two","/example/name/three"]
```

## Test Suite

The package contains a test suite th at runs through expressions sourced from program conditions and the jsonata test suite.
The results of these tests were autogenerated and reviewed, they should be used as a set of tests to ensure against regressions.
The results of the test suite should only be modified after implementing improvements to the library.

Improvements should be documented in the feature file in addition to the automated tests.
