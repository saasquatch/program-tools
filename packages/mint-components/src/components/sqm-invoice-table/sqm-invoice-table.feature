Feature: Invoice Table
    Shows a list of invoices for the current user

  Background: 
    Given the user is logged in
    And the microsite has been configured to show the invoices table

  @minutia
  Scenario: If there are no invoices an empty state is shown
    Given the current user has no invoices
    Then an empty state image is shown in place of the table
    And below the image some text explaining the invoice table is shown

  @minutia
  Scenario: A loading state is displayed while the table is loading
    Given the invoice table is loading
    Then a loading skeleton is shown

  @motivating
  Scenario: The table shows data about the user's invoices
    Given the current user has invoice(s)
    Then the invoices are shown in the table, one per row
    And the data shown is dependent on which columns are configured
    And there exists the possibility the user can download each invoice (given the download column is included)

  @motivating
  Scenario Outline: Invoices for the user are displayed with columns by default
    Given the participant has invoices available
    When the invoices request finishes
    Then <columns> are shown
    And a download button is shown for each invoice

    Examples: 
      | columns            |
      | Date               |
      | Invoice            |
      | Earnings           |
      | Indirect tax       |
      | Earnings after tax |
