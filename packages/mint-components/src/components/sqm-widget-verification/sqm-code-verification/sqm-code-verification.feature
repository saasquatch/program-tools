  Scenario Outline: Codes can be copy-pasted into the code input

    When they paste into the first input
    Then <result> is auto-filled into all code inputs
    And only one character/digit is in each input

    Examples:

    And the cursor focus changes to input <next>
    When they are focussed on input <next>
    And the input is clear
    And they click "Backspace"
    Then the cursor focusses on the input <previous>

      | number | next |

      | 3      | 4    |
