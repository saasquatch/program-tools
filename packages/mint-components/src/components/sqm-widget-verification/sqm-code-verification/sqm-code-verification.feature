Feature: Cash payout code verification widget

  Background: User is on the Cash payouts setting page and sent a code to their email
    Given they are on the Cash payouts setting page

  @minutia
  Scenario Outline: Codes can be copy-pasted into the code input
    Given <code> is on the user's clipboard
    When they paste into the first input
    Then <result> is auto-filled into all code inputs
    And only one character/digit is in each input

    Examples:
      | code    | result |
      | 123456  | 123456 |
      | 1234567 | 123456 |

  @minutia
  Scenario Outline: Focus shifts to the next code input after typing
    Given a user is focused on input <previous>
    When they type any character
    Then the character is filled in the input
    And the cursor focus changes to input <next>
    When they are focussed on input <next>
    And the input is clear
    And they click "Backspace"
    Then the cursor focusses on the input <previous>

    Examples:
      | number | next |
      | 1      | 2    |
      | 2      | 3    |
      | 3      | 4    |
      | 4      | 5    |
      | 5      | 6    |

  Scenario: Clicking a code input highlights its contents
    Given a code input with a character already entered
    When a user clicks on the code input
    Then the character is highlighted

  @minutia
  Scenario: Successful code verification fires an event
    Given a valid code is entered
    And the mutation `verifyUserEmail` is successful
    And an access key is recieved
    Then a "sq:code-verified" event is dispatched
    And it has detail
      """
      { token: <accessKey> }
      """

    Given they are viewing the code verification widget
    And they received a code in their email from the first step
    When they enter the code provided in their email in to the code input

      | janedoe@gmail.com | Enter the code sent to janedoe@gmail.com from our referral provider, impact.com. |

  @minutia
  Scenario: User re-sends verification code to email
    Given they are viewing the code verification widget
    And they see the link text
      """
      Resend Code
      """
    When they press the link text

  Scenario: code-verification sends a 2FA email on first load if it's rendered by itself
    Given `sqm-code-verification` is included in the page's html
    But it is not a child element of `sqm-widget-verification`
    When `sqm-code-verification` loads
    Then it sends a 2FA email to the user's saved publisher email

  Scenario Outline: Email verification prioritises sending to the connected Impact email
    Given a user with participant email <participantEmail>
    And impactConnection <impactConnection>
    When the verification email is sent
    Then <mutation> is called
    And the email is sent to <finalEmail>

    Examples:
      | participantEmail        | impactConnection                       | mutation                       | finalEmail              |
      | null                    | null                                   | N/A                            | N/A                     |
      | participant@example.com | null                                   | requestUserEmailVerification   | participant@example.com |
      | participantEmail        | { user: { email: impact@example.com }} | requestImpactPublisherEmail2FA | impact@example.com      |

  Scenario Outline: Code verification uses different mutations depending on if the user has an impactConnection
    Given a user with participant email <participantEmail>
    And impactConnection <impactConnection>
    And an email was sent with code "123456"
    When the code is submitted
    Then <mutation> is called

    Examples:
      | participantEmail        | impactConnection                       | mutation                          |
      | null                    | null                                   | N/A                               |
      | participant@example.com | null                                   | verifyUserEmail                   |
      | participantEmail        | { user: { email: impact@example.com }} | submitImpactPublisherEmail2FACode |
