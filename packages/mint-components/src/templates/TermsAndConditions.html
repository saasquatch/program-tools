    <h3 style="text-align:center">This user agreement is effective as of July 1, 2024.</h3>

    <h2><b>Advocate by impact.com</b></h2>
    <p>
      This user agreement (“Agreement”) is a contract between you and Impact Tech, Inc.
      (“impact.com”) governing your participation in rewards or cashback programs that are
      serviced by impact.com. In order to participate, you must create an impact.com account
      (“Account”).To use the impact.com services, you must be a resident of a place, and have a
      means to receive payment in such place, that is supported by impact.com technology
      (supported jurisdictions and payment methods available upon sign-up or as may be updated by
      posting a notice from time to time).
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement. The terms
      include the following additional policies (accessible at impact.com/legal), in addition to
      any other agreement that you may enter into from time to time with impact.com, or applicable
      policies including but not limited to our
      <a class="spaced-link" href="https://impact.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may revise this Agreement and any of the policies listed above at any time by posting the
      new version in its place. The revised version will be effective upon the date of posting,
      unless otherwise noted and subject to applicable laws. If our changes reduce your rights or
      increase your responsibilities, we will provide at least 30 days’ notice to you. By
      continuing to use our services after any changes to this Agreement become effective, you
      agree to abide by and be bound by those changes. If you do not agree with any changes to
      this Agreement, cease using your Account and you may notify us to close your impact.com

    <h2><b>Creating an Account</b></h2>
    <p>
      To create an impact.com Account, you must be a resident of a supported jurisdiction, at
      least 18 years old or the age of majority in your place of residence, and have a bank
      account or other approved method of receiving funds. Your Account is personal to you, and
      may not be shared with anyone else. Through your Account, you will be able to (depending
      upon the reward or cashback program terms):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be paid out for amounts earned as a participant in rewards or cashback programs.</li>
      <li>Receive goods through participating in brands’ rewards programs.</li>
      <li>Send participant amounts earned as donations to charitable organizations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is your responsibility to keep confidential any credentials used to access your
      impact.com Account and to keep your phone number, email address, banking or payout method,
      and other contact information current in your impact.com Account profile. Failure to do so
      may result in a loss of amounts earned as a participant, delay in receiving your reward or
      cashback, forfeiture of your Account, or impact.com closing your Account to protect the
      integrity of our services and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you may be paid out amounts earned as a participant, you must submit full, complete,
      and accurate tax information, as applicable to your relevant jurisdiction. Our team will
      conduct due diligence based on the information that you provide. If we are unable to verify
      your identity or if your tax information is incomplete or incorrect, you will have a
      reasonable opportunity to complete or correct such information, but if we are still unable
      to verify you and/or your tax ID your Account will be closed and any earned and pending
      amounts will be forfeited.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Closing Your Account</b></h2>
    <p>
      You may close your impact.com Account and terminate this Agreement at any time. To close
      your impact.com Account, reach out to us via the Help Center. Any pending amounts recorded
      on your Account but not yet earned as a participant will be canceled and removed from your
      account. Closure of your Account does not stop the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An investigation into amounts earned by you as a participant.</li>
      <li>
        Resolution of an open dispute or claim concerning amounts not pending at the time of
        closure.
      </li>
      <li>Repayment of amounts required to be repaid pursuant to this User Agreement.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Earnings Unpayable in Your impact.com Account</b></h2>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise expressly stated, all references to “funds” in these terms and conditions
      mean money denominated in sovereign currency and not cryptocurrency or any other form of
      asset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any earned funds in your impact.com Account represent unsecured claims against impact.com.
      Your impact.com Account does not accrue interest and you have no ownership interest or
      investment in impact.com.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Payment Reviews</b></h3>
    <p>
      Each earned reward or cashback may be reviewed prior to payment. We reserve the right to
      review your Account and reward and cashback activity at any time and for any reason. Amounts
      earned may be placed on hold pending receipt of additional information and/or documentation
      that we ask you to provide in the review process, such as documentation to verify your
      identity. We may withhold payment until verification is completed, and we may reverse or
      cancel rewards or cashback amounts or even terminate your Account as a result of the
      verification process. Other consequences of the review and/or verification process include
      money or payments being applied to amounts you owe to impact.com or reversed for having been
      determined to have been unearned or as a consequence of non-compliance with program terms or
      this User Agreement.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Account Statements</b></h2>
    <p>
      As long as you have access to your active Account, you will be able to view and download
      information regarding your participation in rewards or cashback programs.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Donations</b></h3>
    <p>
      If available, you may donate your earnings as a participant in rewards or cashback programs
      to charitable organizations via impact.com. impact.com does not provide a tax receipt for
      such donations. Charitable organizations are responsible for sending tax receipts directly
      to you. impact.com will share your email address with any charitable organization profile to
      which you send a donation for tax receipt purposes.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Minimum Payout Thresholds and Fees</b></h3>
    <p>
      We may, at our discretion, impose minimum thresholds depending upon the payout method
      elected by you. Additionally, there may be fees associated with some payout methods. Minimum
      thresholds and fees will be disclosed when you are electing your payout method or if you
      change your payout method. We may in our discretion limit or change the payout methods
      available to you. Fees and minimum thresholds may change from time to time in our sole
      discretion.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Taxes and Information Reporting</b></h3>
    <p>
      Amounts that you earn as a participant in a rewards or cashback program do not include any
      taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for
      example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction
      (collectively, “taxes”). It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to
      the payouts you receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and
      remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority. Impact.com is not responsible for
      determining whether any taxes apply to an action, or for calculating, collecting, reporting
      or remitting taxes arising from any action. You acknowledge that we may make certain reports
      to state and federal tax authorities regarding actions (payouts) that you receive pursuant
      to your participation in rewards and cashback programs. For example, impact.com is required
      to report to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments that you receive
      each calendar year via impact.com and that are associated with the same tax identification
      number once you receive at least $600 in payments. We may also have reporting requirements
      to applicable state and local governments. We will send you any necessary forms related to
      your payouts and also transmit them to the relevant tax authority.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Taxpayer Identification Number and Withholding Tax</b></h3>
    <p>
      We may request that you provide your tax identification number and/or a US tax form such as
      W-9 or W-8. If you do not provide us the requested information and documentation, you
      understand and agree that you may be subject to account limitations and federal and state
      withholding tax at the applicable rates on all US source income payments received. We will
      send all withholding taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities and cannot refund those
      amounts.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Charitable Donations</b></h2>
    <p>
      impact.com may enable you the ability to elect charitable organizations which can receive
      donations of amounts earned by you as a participant in a rewards or cashback program that
      enables charity donations. You agree that we may provide your information to your elected
      charitable organizations and provide them with amounts donated by you from your impact.com
      Account. impact.com disclaims all liability for charitable organizations, their compliance
      with laws, rules and regulations, and how they use the funds that you donate to them.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Holds and Limitations</b></h2>
    <h3><b>What are holds and limitations</b></h3>
    <p>
      Under certain circumstances, in order to protect impact.com and the security and integrity
      of our technology and services, impact.com may, in its sole discretion, take Account-level
      or individual transaction actions. A hold may be placed on your impact.com account, which
      temporarily makes earned money unavailable to you and prevents you from earning more during
      such a hold period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our decision about holds may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our
      management of risk and the protection of impact.com, or we may be restricted by regulation
      or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.
      We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      impact.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve temporary holds as
      expeditiously as possible.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process</b></h2>
    <p>
      If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any
      equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in
      order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take
      certain actions, including holding payments to/from your impact.com Account, placing a hold
      on your impact.com Account, or releasing funds. We will decide, in our sole discretion,
      which action is required of us. We do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court
      order or legal process involving you or your impact.com account. When we implement a hold or
      limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other
      legal process, the hold or limitation may remain in place as long as we determine that we
      are required or that it is necessary to do so.

      certain actions, including holding payments to/from your impact.com Account, placing a hold
      on your impact.com Account, or releasing funds. We will decide, in our sole discretion,

    <h3><b>What is not considered an error</b></h3>

      or write us at Impact Tech, Inc., Attn: Error Resolution, 223 E. De La Guerra Street,
      Santa Barbara, CA 93101.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notify us as soon as you can if you discover an error. We must hear from you no later than
      60 days after payment was made to you or, if no payment was made, when payment should have
      been received by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you
      and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45
      days to investigate your complaint or question. Such a timeframe may be extended by up to 90
      days to investigate your complaint or question if impact.com is required to coordinate with
      a third party in relation to such complaint or question.
    </p>
    <p>We will inform you after completing our investigation, and:</p>
    <ul>

        will promptly credit your Account with such an amount.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we decide that there was no error, we will provide you with a written explanation
        through notification within your impact.com Account.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we discover an error, we will remedy such error promptly after we conclude that an error
      has been made. If the error results in you owing money, we may satisfy such outstanding
      amounts from amounts due to be paid to you from your impact.com Account, and if inadequate
      to completely satisfy such outstanding amounts you will be invoiced for the balance owed,
      with payment due net thirty (30) days from the date of such invoice.

      You and impact.com agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis
      and
      not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless
      both you and impact.com agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one
      person's
      or party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class
      proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory
      relief)
      only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
      necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other impact.com
      entities
      or impact.com customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For residents in the <b class="spaced-link"><u>US and Canada</u></b>, any arbitration will be
      administered
      by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the "AAA"). A form for initiating arbitration
      proceedings is available on the AAA's website at <a class="spaced-link" href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.The
      parties agree that the following provisions shall apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For all claims, the Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced, as
        applicable, and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate, shall apply. The AAA's rules are available
        at
        www.adr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration
        consistent with this Agreement to Arbitrate, another administrator will be selected by the parties or
        by
        the court.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any arbitration hearings shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed
        location. If the value of the relief sought is $25,000 or less, the arbitration will be conducted
        based
        solely on written submissions, unless any party requests an in-person, telephonic, or videoconference
        hearing or the arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary. In cases where an in-person hearing is
        held, you and/or impact.com may attend by telephone or videoconference, unless the arbitrator requires
        otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including
        recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. No court or
        arbitrator shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different impact.com or
        impact.com
        customers, but a court or arbitrator will be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same
        impact.com or impact.com customer to the extent required by applicable law. The award of the
        arbitrator
        shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
        court having jurisdiction thereof.
      </li>
      <li>
        Payment of all AAA or arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in
        this
        Agreement to Arbitrate. In the event the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your or
        impact.com’s claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then you or
        impact.com may seek to recover from you or impact.com any fees it paid, including attorneys’ fees, to
        the
        extent permitted by the AAA’s rules and applicable law.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With the exception of any of the provisions regarding prohibiting class and representative actions, if a
      court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts
      of
      this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions regarding
      prohibiting class and representative actions are invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the
      exercise of a non-waivable right (such as the right to pursue public injunctive relief), then any
      dispute
      regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may
      be
      litigated in court. All other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to
      Arbitrate
      shall be arbitrated under its terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any
      amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link
      provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal
      proceeding against impact.com or you prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall
      apply
      to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise
      between you and impact.com. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by providing
      notice through email at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments. If you do not agree
      to
      these amended terms, you may close your impact.com account within the 30-day period and you will not be
      bound by the amended terms.
